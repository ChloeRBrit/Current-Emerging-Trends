# Current-Emerging-Trends
In my project on Artificial Intelligence using Reinforcement Learning, I was provided with most of the foundational code, which included the structure for the reinforcement learning agent and environment setup. My primary contribution was implementing the training portion of the code to handle the neural network's loss calculations and optimize the agent's performance through reinforcement learning techniques. This course has broadened my perspective on AI, deepening my understanding of deep learning algorithms and their ethical implications. As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first identifying client needs and ensuring solutions are both legal and ethical. My responsibilities extend to protecting user data and the organizationâ€™s information, creating unbiased algorithms, and refusing to work with companies that misuse data. This emphasis on ethical practices is crucial in guiding the development of technology that benefits society.
